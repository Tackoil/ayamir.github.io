      <description>Bitrate Adaptation Schemes Client-based Recently, most of the proposed bitrate adaptation schemes reside at the client side, according to the specifications in the DASH standard.&#xA;Purposes:&#xA;Minimal rebuffering events when the playback buffer depletes. Minimal startup delay especially in case of live video streaming. A high overall playback bitrate level with respect to network resources. Minimal video quality oscillations, which occur due to frequent switching. Available bandwidth-based The client makes its representation decisions based on the measured available network bandwidth, which is usually calculated as the size of the fetched segment(s) divided by the transfer time.</description>

      <description>Paper Overview Link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8424813&#xA;Level: IEEE Communications Surveys &amp;amp; Tutorials 2019&#xA;Background Traditional non-HAS IP-based streaming The client receives media that is typically pushed by a media server using connection-oriented protocol such as Real-time Messaging Protocol(RTMP/TCP) or connectionless protocol such as Real-time Transport Protocol(RTP/UDP).&#xA;Real-time Streaming Protocol(RTSP) is a common protocol to control the media servers, which is responsible for setting up a streaming session and keeping the state information during this session, but is not responsible for actual media delivery(task for protocol like RTP).</description>
